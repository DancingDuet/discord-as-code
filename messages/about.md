**What is this?**
This server is a sort of experiment, a server run completely by the community by defining the server as code, and making changes through pull requests.

**Why, though?**
Managing a server can be a bit of a nightmare, especially when it comes to people making unwanted changes, or staff not listening to the community.  This will promote thoughtful discussion about server changes, and ensure that no change is made without approval from a certain number of community members.

**How is this possible?**
Short answer: Terraform and CI/CD
Long answer: We use an awesome tool that is commonly used in the IT space to define a server as code.  Then we use GitHub, and its awesome git workflow to ensure that all changes to the server are approved, and allow people to make comments on changes.

**How can I get involved?**
Check out our github repo: https://github.com/Kelwing/discord-as-code fork it, and make pull request changes to make the server into what you'd like it to be!
